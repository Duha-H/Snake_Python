## Technical Details

- Completed in Python (this version was specifically done in Python 3.7)
- Uses the tkinter binding interface to the Tk GUI library


## How-to-run

1. Clone project
2. Run 'python game.py'

    *If your machine uses a Python version older than 3.0, you might need to update the tkinter imports in game.py and board.py to say 'Tkinter' instead of 'tkinter' for the game to compile properly*
